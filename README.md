# Project work on Intelligent System: Transprecision computing through Deep Neural Network (Python)

## About

This activity is based on transprecision computing problem and it points to use a deep neural network in order to learn how to approximate a calculation. 
Not only aims this project to use a deep neural network for predicting a discrete distribution, but it also compares different approaches of deep neural network: CNN and Fully Connected.

### What is Transprecision computing?

Transprecision Computing aims to abandon the abstraction of "guaranteed numerical precision" and replace it with one
more flexible and efficient. Indeed, the Transprecision Computing, in addition to the already known numerical approximation search, includes a study of mathematical theory and underlying physical principles of the computational approach, as well as the design of algorithms, customized software circuits and tools for the construction of a complex system capable of being used in different applications.
The goal, in fact, is to create a versatile system, which has the potential to be exploited in a wide variety of real problems, even not limited by computing power, that can benefit from the approximation and accuracy of the method itself. The Transprecision Computing, collects know-how related to different branches of knowledge, from programming to material sciences, in order to obtain a system that is not only approximate, but also flexible, robust and able to learn.

All the data has to be seen as a discrete distribution where each bin-th reppresents the probability that the number we are considering for the operation (sum,difference,moltiplication,...) is in the range defined by the bin-th. The lenght of the different ranges (bins) are logarithmic. Basically, it has to be seen as the follow image:
[](/image/example.png) 

However, in order to have a more compact dataset, the input (in0 and in1) is an integer representing the index of the bin that has to be set as 1. The reason why we can set the bin as 1 is because it is an exact discrete distribution: we are sure about the input, so the probability is 1. This is useful because we can easly hot-one encode the input.
On the contrary, the y_i values are not exact, therefore every bins is a value from 0 to 1 (needed to be normalized) and the sum of all the (y_i-th) bins must be 1. The same idea has been done for the error values. 
Different precision's levels can be chosen: float16,float32 or float64. 
(Furthemore, it is also possible to choose the number of bins we desire (65 by default).)
